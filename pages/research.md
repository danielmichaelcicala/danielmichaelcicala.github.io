My research belongs in the domain of network theory.  By
nature, network theory is an interdisciplinary field, with
practitioners coming from pure and applied mathematics,
computer science, the natural sciences, and the social
sciences.  Hence, there are both theoretical and applied
arms to this field. My research strikes a balance between
theoretical and applicable aspects.

##### spans of cospans in a topos (w. kenny courser) [(TAC)](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/33/1/33-01abs.html)

(abstract) If C is a category with chosen pullbacks and a
terminal object then, using a result of Shulman, we obtain a
fully dualizable and symmetric monoidal bicategory Sp(Sp(C))
whose objects are those of C, whose morphisms are spans in
C, and whose 2-morphisms are isomorphism classes of spans of
spans in C. If C is a topos, the first author has previously
constructed a bicategory MonicSp(Csp(C)) whose objects are
those of C, whose morphisms are cospans in C, and whose
2-morphisms are isomorphism classes of spans of cospans in C
with monic legs. We prove this bicategory is also symmetric
monoidal and even compact closed. We discuss applications of
such bicategories to graph rewriting as well as to Morton
and Vicary's combinatorial approach to Khovanov's
categorified Heisenberg algebra.

##### categorifying the zx-calculus [(EPTCS)](http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/paper.cgi?QPL2017.19)

(abstract) This paper presents a symmetric monoidal and compact closed bicategory that categorifies the zx-calculus developed by Coecke and Duncan. The 1-cells in this bicategory are certain graph morphisms that correspond to the string diagrams of the zx-calculus, while the 2-cells are rewrite rules

##### spans of cospans [(TAC)](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/33/6/33-06abs.html)

(abstract) We consider the notion of a span of cospans and define, for them, horizonal and vertical composition. These compositions satisfy the interchange law if working in a topos C and if the span legs are monic. A bicategory is then constructed from C-objects, C-cospans, and doubly monic spans of C-cospans. The primary motivation for this construction is an application to graph rewriting.
